| # | Action | Symbol | Qty | Limit | Confidence | Rationale |
|---|--------|--------|----:|------:|-----------:|-----------|
| 1 | **HOLD** | RELIANCE | 0 | ₹0.0 | 🟢 0.90 | RELIANCE has shown consistent performance and is a key player in the market. Holding onto this position is advisable as it is expected to recover from the current market dip. |
| 2 | **SELL** | ITC | 100 | ₹430.0 | 🟠 0.70 | ITC has reached a significant P&L and is showing signs of stagnation. Selling 100 shares will help lock in profits and reduce exposure to a stock that may not perform as well moving forward. |
